Example use case
----------------

1. Create Form where payment process starts: FormFolder1

    *Edit* >> *Overrides* >> *Custom Success Action*

        traverse_to:string:formfolder2

    * formfolder2 is the next form where the confirmation happens.

2. Add *Decimal Field* with id named **AMOUNT**.

    * Plone automatically set id from title, but with lower cases. To set id upper cases, you may need to change it, for example from Contents tab.

    * Optionally if you want to send email or show results after the successful payment, add Custom Script Adapter here and describe to script body something like::

        items = dict(
            AMOUNT=request.form["AMOUNT"],
            topic=request.form["topic"]
        )
        request.SESSION.set("collective.pfg.payment", items)

    * This means that AMOUNT and topic fields are stored in session and can be displayed after the successful payment.

3. Create another Form: FormFolder2

    *Edit* >> *Overrides* >> *Custom Form Action*

        https://payment.verkkomaksut.fi/

    *View* >> *Actions* >> *Make Order Number Aware*

        Change the numbering behavior if necessary.

        *Here you may set the payment configuration locally. This will overrides global configuration.*

5. Create another Form: FormFolder3

In case e-mails need to be sent and field values displayed after the successful payment.

We use thank-you page automatically created under FormFolder3.

    To show the field values, you need to add or copy the original field which were in FormFolder1 to this FormFolder.

    * The type of field need to be the same as the original one.
    * For example, if you want to show topic and AMOUNT, String Field with id topic and Decimal Number Field with id AMOUNT need to be added under FormFolder3.
